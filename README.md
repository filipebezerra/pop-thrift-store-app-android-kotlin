done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help the developer to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will Developer Learn?

Through this project, developer will:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
